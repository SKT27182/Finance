They also provide advice on mergers and acquisitions, and help companies manage their finances. Investment banks are also known as underwriters.

But the difference, in investment bank, you go to for advice to, but an investment bank is like a consulting firm with an army. And I shouldn't say army. With resources. They know where the money is and they can get it for you. And so, they'll give you advice. And it may share some of the risks of the offering. But the really important thing that investment banks do is put their reputation behind the issue. They check you out, due diligence."

    "- **Registration with SEC**- The company files a registration statement with the SEC. The SEC reviews the registration statement and approves it.\n",

    "- **Cooling off Period**- The SEC requires a cooling off period of 20 days after the registration statement is filed. This is to give investors time to review the registration statement. SEC regulates a document which shows the risk involved in the security so that the investors can make an informed decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Offering Price**- The investment bank and the company decide on the offering price. The offering price is the price at which the shares are sold to the investors. The offering price is determined by the investment bank and the company. The investment bank will advise the company on the offering price. The company will also consider the offering price in deciding whether to go ahead with the offering.\n",
